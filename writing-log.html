                <p>Writing Log is a personal project I had started in 2020, when I first delved into different types of poetry.</p>
				<br>
				<p>As a person who struggles in being able to communicate clearly, I found peace in creative writing as it isn't something you have to do spontaneously! There are also many types of ways to write out there so you do not have to confine yourself to just one type of format. From creating prompts to poetry, there is a lot to see. </p>
				<br>
				<p>I have decided to make this ePortfolio as a 'log' to share my ventures into understanding 'creative writing'!</p>

                <p>When it comes to writing, I there's many ways you can start.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A paper and pen, of course!</li>
				<li>Writing on an iPad (for extra doodles)</li>
				<li>Using the computer</li>
			</ul>
				<p>There is no doubt that we use a lot of devices to type. When you think about starting your creative writing journey, it truly does not matter what tool you decide to utilise! Words are also a form of art on their own.</p>
